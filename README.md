# Intro-notebooks
These notebooks aim to develop basic skills of ML. Pick and choose - depending on what your self-assessment of your skills.

You are encouraged to fork this repository and then clone your fork e.g.:

```git clone git@github.com:<your github handle>/Intro-notebooks.git```

## [Initial setup](SETTING_UP.md)
Gives you a quick run through on how to set up your working environment that you will be using this week - this may also prove useful for your workflows in the future. 

If you are a Beginner - it would probably serve you best to go through the notebooks below. If you already did some ML projects - pick and choose according to where you might have a gap in experience.

## [Jupyter tips and tricks.ipynb](https://github.com/TRISEP-2025-ML-tutorials/Intro-notebooks/blob/main/Jupyter%20tips%20and%20tricks.ipynb)
If you plan to use jupyter you might find some useful tricks here.

## [tensors_broadcasting_graph_backpropagation.ipynb](https://github.com/TRISEP-2025-ML-tutorials/Intro-notebooks/blob/main/tensors_broadcasting_graph_backpropagation.ipynb)
In this notebook we explore how tensors are treated in pytorch - and how to efficiently structure your code through the application of broadcasting. We alo look at the computational graph and backpropagation.

## [deep_learning_building_blocks.ipynb](https://github.com/TRISEP-2025-ML-tutorials/Intro-notebooks/blob/main/deep_learning_building_blocks.ipynb)
Here we get closer to actual deep learning practice - how to set up most basic models and run a training loop. How would one implement basic layers in deep networks.

## [fundamentals_in_numpy.ipynb](https://github.com/TRISEP-2025-ML-tutorials/Intro-notebooks/blob/main/fundamentals_in_numpy.ipynb)
This is only for the interested - how we might go about backprobagation 'by hand' using numpy only. In practice some ML library would always be used.
